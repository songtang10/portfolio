                        For this project, our team worked with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The museum posed
                        to us a project surrounding“Anthropocene To-Go”, an idea of taking Anthropocene topics and
                        translating them into an accessible, online format with an activity. Specifically, the museum
                        prompted us “How can we encourage our online visitors to take a deeper dive into Anthropocene
                        topics in a way that is engaging and fun?”. In response to this design brief, we design A Future
                        without Fossil Fuels, a collaborative imagination game that centers around a card deck of words
                        of inspiration that helps participants imagine a futuristic creation involving renewable energy.

                        research individually. In this round of research, we mainly focused on looking at <b>lay sources</b> such
                        as online articles, youtube videos, kids activity websites to gain an overall understanding of the
                        landscape of at-home science education and popular Anthropocene topics.

                        Through research, we want to emphasize a design activity that provides <b>flexible learning opportunities instead of direct knowledge transmission</b>. Current museum spaces pose many difficulties for inquiry-styled learning, but these limitations can be eliminated in a <b>hybrid/virtual setting</b>, like the Anthropocene-to-Go project: the users accessing the activity at home will have autonomy of their time and a sense of comfort in their own space. This provides an exciting opportunity for our team to design for an <b>at-home interaction without the pre-existing time/spatial limitation at the museum's space, and thus ignite a more inquiry-styled learning format</b>.

                        Besides readings and design inspirations, interviews also played an important role in our project development. We conducted a total of <b>7 interviews</b> with the CMNH staff as well as renewable energy and sustainability industry professionals. A few central themes emerged that guided our thinking and perspective into how we might design for changing mindsets and future action:

                            <p>A delicate balance between retaining deep knowledge and nuance, such as that about renewable energy processes, must be balanced with curating content into a short, digestible, and accessible format, in order to create an experience that is both engaging/fun and educational or has some form of tangible impact.</p>

                        Because of the openness of the Anthropocene To-Go project brief, our team struggled a bit during the initial research/ideation phase. There are three main topics that our group shared collective interest on: Invasive Plants, Fossil Fuels and Carbon Footprints.

                    <p>In an interview with a CMNH exhibit designer and curator, they mentioned the “What’s a Fossil Fuel?” exhibit and indicated that it could use some extra help, and would serve as a great opportunity for this project.</p>

                    <p>As a result, we decided to shift focus from Carbon Footprint to Fossil Fuels. And taking inspiration from the design activities mentioned in the previous sections, our team finally narrowed the format of our activity to an imaginative card game. </p>
